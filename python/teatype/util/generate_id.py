def generate_id(truncate:int=None) -> str:
    """
    Creates a 60-character pseudo-random UUID using a custom algorithm that incorporates the current timestamp.
    This method avoids revealing the machine's MAC address, unlike the standard UUID1.

    The algorithm has been tested to prevent collisions in both single-threaded and multi-threaded environments.

    Args:
        truncate (int, optional): If provided and less than 60, truncates the UUID to the specified length. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        str: The generated 60-character UUID.
