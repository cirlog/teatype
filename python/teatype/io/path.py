    Retrieve the path of the calling script.

    This function inspects the call stack to determine the file path of the script
    that invoked this function. It allows retrieval of the path either as a string
    or as a Path object based on the `stringify` parameter.

    Args:
        skip_call_stacks (int): The number of frames to skip in the call stack.
        stringify (bool): Determines the return type of the script path.
                          - If True, returns the path as a string.

                          Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        str: The caller's script path as a string if `stringify` is True.
