now that the undo system works, do a redo system that keeps track of all steps i undoed, until i make a new change, then toss all the redoes out, like all other programs work, also, make it so, that if a text is in edit mode, the taskbar works like word, where the marked words are made bold or all words written from now are bold, like other text editors work, so basically an alternative to click formatting (which works when not editing text directly), so that i have both alternatives available to me, also how reliable is the undo system? do you neatly track the changes locally scoped to each notes seperate? since they are persistent, let the user keep track of the changes, on the left next to the taskbar, display a small grayed text with number of changes and then if you click on it, open a hovering list of the changes that i can undo/redo in a sensible manner, also, when i edit a text, the textbox is still larger than the content, i dont like that really that much, also, make a extender thats only visible when hovering near the edge of the text, that allows me to adjust the width of the display text, with max-width being the width of the box, and keep it as an internally tracked percentage thats stored persistently, so that its responsive (its deleted when deleting all data), also keep track of sidebar closed, implement a lightmode variant in the settings which you also keep track of and then, create an export functionality for my notes, that allows me to export and download my notes as raw text without formatting or as files that i can later import into the app that keeps formating (use json for this), also the box color modal does not close on focus loss also, enter does not create a new line in my textbox, it closes it, i dont like that and if i do a - starting a list, convert to a bullet because it looks cleaner
